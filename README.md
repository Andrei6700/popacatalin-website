# Fitness Trainer Websites
This project is based on CSS and HTML, which represents a website about a fitness trainer, named Popa Catalin, which I created so that the user can see the services he offers and at the same time for his presentation as a trainer .

# Why hasn't the project received updates?
This project has not received any updates since it no longer came with a pricing plan and a detailed description of the site.
